# Workshop 3: Templates

In this workshop, you design and code a couple of class templates and test them on different instantiations.



## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this workshop, you will have demonstrated the abilities to:

- design and code a class template
- template a class variable
- specialize a class template for a particular type
- instantiate a template class
- specialize a member function of a class template to process a particular type
- derivate a template class from another template class



## Submission Policy

The workshop is divided into two coding parts and one non-coding part:

- *Part 1*: worth 50% of the workshop's total mark, is due on **Wednesday at 23:59:59** of the week of your scheduled lab.
- *Part 2*: worth 50% of the workshop's total mark, is due on **Sunday at 23:59:59** of the week of your scheduled lab.  Submissions of *Part 2* that do not contain the *reflection* are not considered valid submissions and are ignored.
- *reflection*: non-coding part, to be submitted together with *Part 2*. Te reflection doesn't have marks associated to it, but can incur a **penalty of max 40% of the whole workshop's mark** if your professor deems it insufficient (you make your marks from the code, but you can lose some on the reflection).

If at the deadline the workshop is not complete, there is an extension of **one day** when you can submit the missing parts.  **The code parts that are submitted late receive 0%.**  After this extra day, the submission closes; if the workshop is incomplete when the submission closes (missing at least one of the coding or non-coding parts), **the mark for the entire workshop is 0%**.

Every file that you submit must contain (as a comment) at the top **your name**, **your Seneca email**, **Seneca Student ID** and the **date** when you completed the work.

If the file contains only your work, or work provided to you by your professor, add the following message as a comment at the top of the file:

> I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.


If the file contains work that is not yours (you found it online or somebody provided it to you), **write exactly which part of the assignment are given to you as help, who gave it to you, or which source you received it from.**  By doing this you will only lose the mark for the parts you got help for, and the person helping you will be clear of any wrong doing.


## Compiling and Testing Your Program

All your code should be compiled using this command on `matrix`:

```bash
/usr/local/gcc/9.1.0/bin/g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -g -o ws file1.cpp file2.cpp ...
```

- `-Wall`: compiler will report all warnings
- `-std=c++17`: the code will be compiled using the C++17 standard
- `-g`: the executable file will contain debugging symbols, allowing *valgrind* to create better reports
- `-o ws`: the compiled application will be named `ws`

After compiling and testing your code, run your program as following to check for possible memory leaks (assuming your executable name is `ws`):

```bash
valgrind ws
```

To check the output, use a program that can compare text files.  Search online for such a program for your platform, or use *diff* available on `matrix`.


If, when you try to compile/submit the workshop on matrix, you encounter an error regarding `/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version 'CXXABI_1.3.9 not found'﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿`, add the following line at the end of your `.bashrc` file (this is a hidden text file located in the home folder--`~`--of your matrix account):

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/gcc/9.1.0/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

After you edit the file, logout and login again--this problem should go away.




## Part 1 (50%)

This workshop consists of three modules:
- `w3` (supplied)
- `Set`
- `SetSummable`
- `Pair`
- `PairSummable`

Enclose all your source code within the `sdds` namespace and include the necessary guards in each header file.



### `w3` Module (supplied)


**Do not modify this module!**  Look at the code and make sure you understand it.



### `Set` Module

This module defines a class template for a collection of elements of any data type (for example, a set of `int`, or a set `Student`, etc.)

Design and code a class template named `Set` for managing a statically allocated array of any datatype.  The template parameters in order of their specification are:

- `T`: the type of any element in the array
- `N`: the maximum number of elements in the array (an integer without sign)

Your design should be able to distinguish between
- the capacity of the array (`N`)
- the number of elements added to the set. Initially the set is empty.


**This module should not use or know the type `Pair`!!**



***Public Members***

- `size_t size() const`: returns the number of elements in the set
- `const T& operator[](size_t idx) const`: returns the element at index `i` (assume the parameter is valid).
- `void operator+=(const T& item)`: if the set didn't reach the capacity, add a copy of the parameter to the array. Otherwise, do nothing.





### `Pair` Module


Design and code a class template named `Pair` for managing a *key-value* pair. The template parameters identify the types of the key and value objects that constitute a `Pair` object:
- `K`: the type of the key
- `V`: the type of the value

**This module should not use or know the type `Set`!!**


***Public Members***
- default constructor
- `Pair(const K& key, const V& value)`: copies the values received in the parameters into instance variables
- `const K& key() const`: returns the **key** component of the pair
- `const V& value() const`: returns the **value** component of the pair
- `void display(std::ostream& os) const`: inserts into the parameter the key and value of the pair in the following format
  ```
  KEY : VALUE<endl>
  ```


***Free Helpers***
- `std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream& os, const Pair<K, V>& pair)`: calls the function `Pair<L, V>::display()` to insert a pair into the stream.





### Sample Output

```
w3.exe sales.txt
```
the output should look like:
```

### Submission

To test and demonstrate execution of your program use the same data as shown in the output example above.

Upload your source code to your `matrix` account. Compile and run your code using the latest version of the `g++` compiler (available at `/usr/local/gcc/9.1.0/bin/g++`) and make sure that everything works properly.

Then, run the following command from your account (replace `profname.proflastname` with your professor’s Seneca userid):
```
~profname.proflastname/submit 345_w3_p1
```
and follow the instructions.

**:warning:Important:** Please note that a successful submission does not guarantee full credit for this workshop. If the professor is not satisfied with your implementation, your professor may ask you to resubmit. Resubmissions will attract a penalty.




## Part 2 (50%)

The second part of this workshop upgrades your solution to include
- alignment of the key and value output in pretty columnar format
- accumulation of the values stored in a `Set`, for a specified key

To implement each upgrade, you will derive a templated class from your original templated class (one derived class from `Set` and one derived class from `Pair`) and specialize the class derived from `Pair` as described below.





### `Pair` Module

Modify the function `display()` in the class `Pair` to enable polymorphism on it.

No other changes are necessary in this module.





### `PairSummable` Module

Add a new module called `PairSummable` that represents a `Pair` with summation and key alignment functionality.

This class is derived from `Pair<K, V>`, and receives 2 template parameters:
- `K`: the type of the key
- `V`: the type of the value

**This module should not use or know the type `Set` or `SetSummable`!!**


***Static Private Members for `PairSummable`***

- an object of type `V` that holds the *initial value* for starting a summation. The initial value depends on the type of the value in the key-value pair and will be defined separately.
- a variable of type `size_t` that holds the minimum field width for pretty columnar output of key-value pairs (initialize it with 0). This is the minimum number of characters needed to display any of the key in a set of keys.

  This value must be updated every time a new pair is added to the collection.



***Static Public Members for `PairSummable`***

- `static const V& getInitialValue()`: return the initial value stored.



***Public Members for `PairSummable`***

- default constructor

- `PairSummable(const K& key, const V& value)`: stores the pair in the collection, and updates the field width if necessary.
  This functions assumes that the type `K` supports a function named `size()` that returns the number of characters required to display `key`.

- `V sum(const K& key, const V& val) const`:
  - If the key of the pair stored in the current instance is `key`, then add the value of the pair and `val` together and return the result. Use `+` for addition.
  - Otherwise, return `val`.

- overload the `display()` function to set the alignment to left and the field width and then call `display()` from the parent class. At the end, restore the alignment to right.



***Specializations***

- for `K = std::string` and `V = std::string`, the initial value for summation should be set to empty string (`""`).

- for `K = std::string` and `V = int`, the initial value for summation should be set to 0.

- for `K = std::string` and `V = std::string`, the function `sum()` should concatenate the values stored using `, ` as separator (use operator `+` to concatenate strings).




### `Set` Module

The template class `Set` doesn't need any change.




### `SetSummable` Module

Add to the project a **template** class called `SetSummable`, that can manage a collection of *summable* elements.

This class is derived from `Set<T, N>`, and receives 4 template parameters:
- `T`: the type of any element in the collection
- `N`: the maximum number of elements in the collection (an integer without sign)
- `K`: the type of a key
- `V`: the type summation value

In this design, *summable* elements are objects of a type that supports the operation `V sum(const K& key, const V& val)`.


**This module should not use or know the type `Pair` or `PairSummable`!!**



***Public Members for `SetSummable`***

- `V accumulate(const K& key) const`: this function accumulates all the values stored in the collection that have the key `key` into a local object of type `V`.

  - get the initial value from the type `T` and store it into a local variable of type `V`: this is the accumulator.
    In this design, the type `T` must have a static member called `getInitialValue()`.

  - iterate over the collection and call the function `sum()` for each item (use the overloaded `operator[]` to access the item at index `i`). Store the result of `sum()` into the accumulator.

  - return the accumulator to the client.


Once the implementation of this module is complete, if you attempt to instantiate the class `SetSummable` using a type `T` that doesn't support the `sum()` and `getInitialValue()` operations, you will receive compilation errors **for that specific instantiation**.

### Reflection

Study your final solution, reread the related parts of the course notes, and make sure that you have understood the concepts covered by this workshop. **This should take no less than 30 minutes of your time.**

Create a **text** file named `reflect.txt` that contains your detailed description of the topics that you have learned in completing this particular workshop and mention any issues that caused you difficulty and how you solved them. Include in your explanation—**but do not limit it to**—the following points:
- the reason for specializing the `sum()` member function.
- the reason for specializing the initial value for a summation.
- the reason for defining the class variable outside the class definition.



#### Quiz Reflection

Add a section to `reflect.txt` called **Quiz X Reflection**. Replace the **X** with the number of the last quiz that you received and list all questions that you answered incorrectly.

Then for each incorrectly answered question write your mistake and the correct answer to that question. If you have missed the last quiz, then write all the questions and their answers.




### Submission

To test and demonstrate execution of your program use the same data as shown in the output example above.

Upload the source code and the reflection file to your `matrix` account. Compile and run your code using the latest version of the `g++` compiler (available at `/usr/local/gcc/9.1.0/bin/g++`) and make sure that everything works properly.

Then, run the following command from your account (replace `profname.proflastname` with your professor’s Seneca userid):
```
~profname.proflastname/submit 345_w3_p2
```
and follow the instructions.

**:warning:Important:** Please note that a successful submission does not guarantee full credit for this workshop. If the professor is not satisfied with your implementation, your professor may ask you to resubmit. Resubmissions will attract a penalty.
