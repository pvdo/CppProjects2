# Workshop 5: Functions and Error Handling


In this workshop, you code a function object, a lambda expression, and exception handling. 

You are to create a template class that manages a collection of objects of type `T`. The client of this class will be able to register a callback function (an observer) that will be called every time a new item has been added successfully.

You are to work with a collection of books and another collection of movies, both loaded from files. The information about books/movies contains mistakes:
- You are to create a lambda expression that fixes the price information about a book
- You are to create a function object (functor) that will fix some spelling mistakes in the description and titles for books/movies.

In case of exceptional situations, you are to generate and handle exceptions
- the functor will load the misspelled words from a file, but if the file is missing, and exception should be generated.
- iterating over the collection using indices, should generate an exception if the index is not valid.



## Learning Outcomes

Upon successful completion of this workshop, you will have demonstrated the abilities to:

- design and code a templated class that allocates and deallocates dynamic memory
- design and code a function object
- design and code a lambda expression
- code a member function that receives the address of another function to execute 
- throw exceptions of different types
- distinguish exception types



## Submission Policy

The workshop is divided into two coding parts and one non-coding part:

- *Part 1*: worth 50% of the workshop's total mark, is due on **Wednesday at 23:59:59** of the week of your scheduled lab.
- *Part 2*: worth 50% of the workshop's total mark, is due on **Sunday at 23:59:59** of the week of your scheduled lab.  Submissions of *Part 2* that do not contain the *reflection* are not considered valid submissions and are ignored.
- *reflection*: non-coding part, to be submitted together with *Part 2*. Te reflection doesn't have marks associated to it, but can incur a **penalty of max 40% of the whole workshop's mark** if your professor deems it insufficient (you make your marks from the code, but you can lose some on the reflection).

If at the deadline the workshop is not complete, there is an extension of **one day** when you can submit the missing parts.  **The code parts that are submitted late receive 0%.**  After this extra day, the submission closes; if the workshop is incomplete when the submission closes (missing at least one of the coding or non-coding parts), **the mark for the entire workshop is 0%**.

Every file that you submit must contain (as a comment) at the top **your name**, **your Seneca email**, **Seneca Student ID** and the **date** when you completed the work.

If the file contains only your work, or work provided to you by your professor, add the following message as a comment at the top of the file:

> I have done all the coding by myself and only copied the code that my professor provided to complete my workshops and assignments.


If the file contains work that is not yours (you found it online or somebody provided it to you), **write exactly which part of the assignment are given to you as help, who gave it to you, or which source you received it from.**  By doing this you will only lose the mark for the parts you got help for, and the person helping you will be clear of any wrong doing.


## Compiling and Testing Your Program

All your code should be compiled using this command on `matrix`:

```bash
/usr/local/gcc/9.1.0/bin/g++ -Wall -std=c++17 -g -o ws file1.cpp file2.cpp ...
```

- `-Wall`: compiler will report all warnings
- `-std=c++17`: the code will be compiled using the C++17 standard
- `-g`: the executable file will contain debugging symbols, allowing *valgrind* to create better reports
- `-o ws`: the compiled application will be named `ws`

After compiling and testing your code, run your program as following to check for possible memory leaks (assuming your executable name is `ws`):

```bash
valgrind ws
```

To check the output, use a program that can compare text files.  Search online for such a program for your platform, or use *diff* available on `matrix`.


If, when you try to compile/submit the workshop on matrix, you encounter an error regarding `/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version 'CXXABI_1.3.9 not found'﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿`, add the following line at the end of your `.bashrc` file (this is a hidden text file located in the home folder--`~`--of your matrix account):

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/gcc/9.1.0/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

After you edit the file, logout and login again--this problem should go away.




## Part 1 (50%)

The first part of this workshop consists of modules:
- `w5` (partially supplied)
- `Book`

Enclose all your source code within the `sdds` namespace and include the necessary guards in each header file.





### `Book` Module

This module defines a class that holds information about a single book.

Design and code a class named `Book` that should be able to store the following information (for each attribute, you can chose any type you think it's appropriate--you must be able to justify the decisions you have made):

- **author**
- **title**
- **the country of publication**
- **the year of publication**
- **the price of the book**
- **the description**: the summary of the book


***Public Members***
- a default constructor
- `const std::string& title() const`: a query that returns the title of the book
- `const std::string& country() const`: a query that returns the publication country
- `const size_t& year() const`: a query that returns the publication year
- `double& price()`: a function that returns the price **by reference**, allowing you to update the price
- `Book(const std::string& strBook)`: A constructor that receives the book as a string; this constructor is responsible to extract the information about the book from the parameter and store it in the attributes of the instance. The parameter will always have the following format:
```
AUTHOR,TITLE,COUNTRY,PRICE,YEAR,DESCRIPTION
```
  This constructor should remove all spaces from the **beginning and end** of any token in the string.

  When implementing the constructor, consider the following functions:
  - [std::string::substr()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/substr)
  - [std::string::find()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/find)
  - [std::string::erase()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/erase)
  - [std::stoi()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/stol)
  - [std::stod()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/stof)

**Add any other function that is required by your design!**


***Friend Helpers***
- overload the insertion operator to insert the content of a book object into an **ostream** object, in the following format:
```
AUTHOR | TITLE | COUNTRY | YEAR | PRICE | DESCRIPTION
```
  - the **author** should be printed on a field of size 20;
  - the **title** should be printed on a field of size 22;
  - the **country** should be printed on a field of size 5;
  - the **year** should be printed on a field of size 4;
  - the **price** should be printed on a field of size 6, and should have 2 digits;
  - see alignment in the sample output.






### `w5` Module (partially supplied)


This module has some missing parts. The missing parts are marked with `TODO`, describing what code you should add and where. **Do not modify the existing code, only add what is missing!**


### Sample Output

When the program is started with the command (the file `book.txt` is provided):
```
w5.exe book.txt
```
the output should look like the one from the `sample_output.txt` file.




### Submission

To test and demonstrate execution of your program use the same data as shown in the output example above.

Upload your source code to your `matrix` account. Compile and run your code using the latest version of the `g++` compiler (available at `/usr/local/gcc/9.1.0/bin/g++`) and make sure that everything works properly.

Then, run the following command from your account (replace `profname.proflastname` with your professor’s Seneca userid):
```
~profname.proflastname/submit 345_w5_p1
```
and follow the instructions.

**:warning:Important:** Please note that a successful submission does not guarantee full credit for this workshop. If the professor is not satisfied with your implementation, your professor may ask you to resubmit. Resubmissions will attract a penalty.




## Part 2 (50%)

The second part of this workshop upgrades your solution to include more modules:
- `Movie`
- `SpellChecker`
- `Collection`




### `SpellChecker` Module (functor)


Add a `SpellChecker` module to your project. This module should maintain two arrays of strings, both of size 5 (statically allocated):
- `m_badWords`: an array with 5 misspelled words
- `m_goodWords`: an array with the correct spelling of those 5 words


***Public Members***

- `SpellChecker(const char* filename);`: a constructor that receives as a parameter the name of the file that contains the misspelled words. If the file is missing, this constructor should generate an exception of type `const char*`, with the message `Bad file name!`
  - this constructor should load the content of the file. Each line from the file is in the format `BAD_WORD  GOOD_WORD`; the two fields can be separated by any number of spaces.

- `void operator()(std::string& text) const`
  - this operator should search in `text` if any of the misspelled words appear and replace them with the correct version.

When implementing the operator, consider the following functions:
  - [std::string::find()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/find)
  - [std::string::replace()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/replace)




### `Book` Module


Add to the `Book` class a public template function:
- `void fixSpelling(T spellChecker)`: this function should call the overloaded `operator()` on instance `spellChecker`, passing to it the book description.

  In this design, type `T` must have an overload of the `operator()` that accepts a string as a parameter.

  **Since this is a template function, it must be implemented in the header!** The class is not a template.




### `Movie` Module

Design and code a class named `Movie` that should be able to store the following information (for each attribute, you can chose any type you think it's appropriate--you must be able to justify the decisions you have made):

- **title**
- **the year of release**
- **the description**


***Public Members***
- a default constructor
- `const std::string& title() const`: a query that returns the title of the movie
- `Movie(const std::string& strMovie)`: A constructor that receives the movie as a string; this constructor is responsible to extract the information about the movie from the parameter and store it in the attributes of the instance. The parameter will always have the following format:
```
TITLE,YEAR,DESCRIPTION
```
  This constructor should remove all spaces from the **beginning and end** of any token in the string.

  When implementing the constructor, consider the following functions:
  - [std::string::substr()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/substr)
  - [std::string::find()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/find)
  - [std::string::erase()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/erase)
  - [std::stoi()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/stol)

- `void fixSpelling(T spellChecker)`: a template function. This function should call the overloaded `operator()` on instance `spellChecker`, passing to it the movie title and description.

  In this design, type `T` must have an overload of the `operator()` that accepts a string as a parameter.

  **Since this is a template function, it must be implemented in the header!** The class is not a template.

**Add any other function that is required by your design!**


***Friend Helpers***
- overload the insertion operator to insert the content of a movie object into an **ostream** object, in the following format:
```
TITLE | YEAR | DESCRIPTION
```
  - the **title** should be printed on a field of size 40;
  - the **year** should be printed on a field of size 4;




### `Collection` Module


Add a `Collection` module to your project. The purpose of this class is to manage a collection items of template type `T`. Since this is template class, it doesn't need a `.cpp` file.

This module should manage a **dynamically allocated** array of objects of type `T`, resizing it when a new item is added. Using a callback function, this class will inform the client when a new item has been added to the collection.

The class collection will provide two overloads for `operator[]` to access the stored item. 


***Private Data***

- the name of the collection;
- a dynamically allocated array of items `T`
- the size of the array
- a pointer to a function that returns `void` and receives two parameters of type `const Collection<T>&` and `const T&`.

  This is the **observer** function (it *observes* an event): when an item has been added to the collection, the class `Collection<T>` will call this function informing the client about the adition.


***Public Members***

- `Collection(std::string name)`: sets the name of the collection to the parameter and all other attributes to their default value
- this class doesn't support copy operations; delete them.
- a destructor
- `const std::string& name() const`: a query that returns the name of the collection.
- `size_t size() const`: a query that returns how many items are in the collection.

- `void setObserver(void (*observer)(const Collection<T>&, const T&))`: stores the parameter into an attribute, to be used when an item is added to the collection. The parameter is a pointer to a function that returns `void` and accepts two parameters: a collection and an item that has just been added to the collection.

- `Collection<T>& operator+=(const T& item)`: adds a copy of `item` to the collection, only if the collection doesn't contain an item with the same title (type `T` has a member function called `title()` that returns the title of the item). If `item` is already in the collection, this function does nothing.  If the item is not already in the collection, this function:
  - resize the array to accomodate the new item
  - if there is an observer registered, call the observer function passing `*this` and the new item as parameters.

- `T& operator[](size_t idx) const`: returns the item at index `idx`.
  - if the index is out of range, this function throws an exception of type `std::out_of_range` with the message `Bad index [IDX]. Collection has [SIZE] items.`. Use operator `+` to concatenate strings.

  When implementing this operator, consider the following:
  - [std::to_string()](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/to_string)
  - [std::out_of_range](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/error/out_of_range)

- `T* operator[](std::string title) const`: returns the address of the item with title `title` (type `T` has a member function called `title()` that returns the title of the item). If no such item exists, this function returns `nullptr`.


***FREE Helpers***

- overload the insertion operator to insert the content of a `Collection` object into an **ostream** object. Iterate over all elements in the collection and insert each one into the `ostream` object (do not add newlines).


**:warning:Important: The class `Collection` should have no knowledge of any of the custom types you have defined (`Book`, `Movie`, `SpellChecker`).** 



### Sample Output

When the program is started with the command (the files are provided):
```
w5.exe books.txt movies.txt missing_file.txt words.txt
```
the output should look like the one from the `sample_output.txt` file.




### Reflection

Study your final solution, reread the related parts of the course notes, and make sure that you have understood the concepts covered by this workshop. **This should take no less than 30 minutes of your time.**

Create a **text** file named `reflect.txt` that contains your detailed description of the topics that you have learned in completing this particular workshop and mention any issues that caused you difficulty and how you solved them. Include in your explanation—**but do not limit it to**—the following points:
- the difference between the implementations/utilizations of a functor and a lambda expression.  When is appropriate to use each one?
- the constructor for `SpellChecker` generates an exception in certain conditions.  How would you change your code to achieve the same result, but without exceptions (both on the constructor and on the client side)? Compare the two solutions.
- the classes `Movie` and `Book` contain almost identical logic in loading data from the file. How would you redesign the classes in order **not** to duplicate that logic?
- the classes `Movie` and `Book` are instantiated from the `main()` function using a custom constructor, but they also contain a default constructor.  Is the default constructor necessary? Could you remove it? Justify your answer.



#### Quiz Reflection

Add a section to `reflect.txt` called **Quiz X Reflection**. Replace the **X** with the number of the last quiz that you received and list all questions that you answered incorrectly.

Then for each incorrectly answered question write your mistake and the correct answer to that question. If you have missed the last quiz, then write all the questions and their answers.




### Submission

To test and demonstrate execution of your program use the same data as shown in the output example above.

Upload the source code and the reflection file to your `matrix` account. Compile and run your code using the latest version of the `g++` compiler (available at `/usr/local/gcc/9.1.0/bin/g++`) and make sure that everything works properly.

Then, run the following command from your account (replace `profname.proflastname` with your professor’s Seneca userid):
```
~profname.proflastname/submit 345_w5_p2
```
and follow the instructions.

**:warning:Important:** Please note that a successful submission does not guarantee full credit for this workshop. If the professor is not satisfied with your implementation, your professor may ask you to resubmit. Resubmissions will attract a penalty.
